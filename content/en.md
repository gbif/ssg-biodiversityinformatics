GBIC2: the 2nd Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference
===================

> Delegates to the 2nd Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference, or **GBIC2**, called for a global [_alliance for biodiversity knowledge_](https://www.allianceforbio.org] to align efforts to deliver current, accurate and comprehensive data, information and knowledge on the world’s biodiversity. The website for this ongoing effort has now been established at [allianceforbio.org](https://www.allianceforbio.org).

The first GBIC conference took place in Copenhagen, Denmark in July 2012 and led to the publication of the _Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook_, or ([GBIO](./gbio)), which laid out a vision of the major areas where biodiversity informatics needed to advance. 

This alliance is open to all institutions, agencies, organizations, researchers and communities working to measure and monitor biodiversity or dependent on accurate information on biodiversity. By joining forces, every stakeholder will benefit from free and open access to the best possible evidence to address questions at all scales.

Join us in the next phase—help us in aligning resources and investments in biodiversity informatics to improve knowledge of the world's species and understanding of the dynamics of natural systems in support of a sustainable future for science and society.

[Recent efforts](./background) have repeatedly identified the need for biodiversity informatics stakeholders to collaborate at a global scale to identify common priorities and coordinate implementation of these priorities.

> There is a clear need for an open and trusted mechanism that allows the international community to develop a shared vision for each of the component areas in the GBIO, and to agree on the major elements and components which need to be prioritized to achieve these visions. 

Once such priorities are agreed, continued coordination could allow the community to support efforts by agencies and institutions in different countries to secure funding and to implement these components. 

GBIC2 convened a broad group of invited stakeholders to discuss how an international coordination mechanism for biodiversity informatics could operate and how it could accelerate delivery of the linked and open global biodiversity data infrastructure to the benefit of science and society. The workshop also gave careful consideration to issues around governance and trust, technical and sociological factors, and funding and sustainability for establishing such a mechanism. In order to keep the scope of the initial discussions practical, GBIC2 included parallel sessions exploring challenges which will arise in developing **priorities and a multi-year roadmap for each of four GBIO component areas**: 
+ [Biodiversity knowledge network](/en/programme/knowledge-network)
+ [Published materials](/en/programme/published-materials)
+ [Integrated occurrence data](/en/programme/occurrence-data)
+ [Trends and predictions](/en/programme/trends)

**While attendance was necessarily limited, and discussions were conducted entirely in English, GBIC2 represented just the opening stage of a broader consultation process**. The recommendations and [outcomes](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679) resulting from the workshop have been established at [allianceforbio.org](https://www.allianceforbio.org) and translated into multiple languages.
