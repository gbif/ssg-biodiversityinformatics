The GBIC2 workshop identified [next steps](../call-to-action/#nextsteps) that require further exploration as part of establishing an alliance for biodiversity knowledge.

Over the coming months, there will be opportunity to contribute to web consultations and comment on draft white papers on each of these topics.

To begin this process, GBIF has opened discussion threads (links above) under its community forum. We encourage you to sign up to the forum and contribute your ideas to these discussions. Please note that __contributions in languages other than English are welcomed__.
