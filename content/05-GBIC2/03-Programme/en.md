### Post-GBIC2 activity
+ Following GBIC2, the plan is to expand participation in the discussion by sharing a report on workshop's findings and a draft model of an international coordination mechanism. Distribution of both the report and the consultation in multiple languages will enable the widest possible participation while ensuring that follow-on implementation does not exclude speakers of any particular language or from any particular region.
+ The subsequent goal is to seek funding to establish and support joint planning practices based on the recommended model.

## <a name="areas"></a>GBIO component areas for parallel workshops

GBIC2 will include in-depth explorations of one key component from each of the four layers identified in the [GBIO framework](/raw/GBIO-framework.pdf). Focusing on these components will ensure broad consideration of technical and societal aspects while addressing both well-understood elements and others for which solutions are at best preliminary.

+ [**Biodiversity knowledge network**](./knowledge-network/) (Culture): Developing models, social networks, reputation and recognition systems to empower and reward professionals and knowledgeable amateurs to contribute to the curation and improvement of digital biodiversity information. This component area involves mostly sociological aspects of integration and change, bringing together skills from a different set of contributors.
+ [**Published materials**](./published-materials) (Data): Addressing the challenges of offering digital access to centuries of information gathered and stored in non-digital formats, including transformation of this information into structured data for synthesis with existing digital resources. This component area involves a diverse stakeholders with opportunities to increase alignment and reuse of informatics tools, including optical character recognition, gazetteers and vocabularies, and automated translation services.
+ [**Integrated occurrence data**](./occurrence-data/) (Evidence): Aligning activities around the world to aggregate spatial evidence of species occurrence, removing duplication of effort, and ensuring delivery of the most comprehensive integrated data resource possible. This component area offers immediate opportunities for alignment since several key infrastructures are already starting discussions on how to achieve this.
+ [**Trends and predictions**](./trends) (Understanding): Delivering time-sensitive analyses of available evidence and developing robust models for past and future scenarios. This component area presents different challenges around credibility, governance and integration of multiple sources of biotic and abiotic information.
