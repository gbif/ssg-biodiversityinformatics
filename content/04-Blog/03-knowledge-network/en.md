# The role of the expert community within the _alliance for biodiversity knowledge_
_[Donald Hobern](mailto:dhobern@gbif.org), GBIF Secretariat, 12 March 2019_

The [Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook](https://www.biodiversityinformatics.org/en/gbio/) (GBIO) assigned a key role to what it called the _Biodiversity Knowledge Network_, part of the **Culture** tier in the GBIO framework. This component of the framework relates to developing models, social networks, reputation and recognition systems to empower and reward professionals and knowledgeable amateurs to contribute to the curation and improvement of digital biodiversity information. 

The importance of this component was also recognized in the GBIC2 workshop. The _Biodiversity Knowledge Network_ was selected as one of four GBIO components for in-depth workshop discussions, summarized in _Annex A_ of the _alliance_ paper in _Biodiversity Informatics Journal_: [Outputs from GBIC2 Working Groups](https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.7.e33679.suppl1).
