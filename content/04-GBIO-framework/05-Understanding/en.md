Understanding
===================

The Understanding focus area enables a broader synthesis, providing the modelling tools to enable us to look at whole ecosystems, make better policy decisions and react to any changes.

**Deliver evidence-based models of biodiversity patterns, trends and function**

Combine all sources of biodiversity knowledge and data resources from other earth observing systems and other domains to generate new information, inform policy and decision-makers and educate wider society.

### Multiscale spatial modelling

**Model biodiversity patterns using all available evidence**
Integrate data collected at all scales with earth observing systems from other domains and with taxon-specific biological information to create the fullest possible picture of geographical species distributions.

### Trends and predictions

**Evaluate biodiversity patterns across time and space to explore drivers and impacts and to forecast future states**
Integrate historical data and evidence of changes over time to assess trends and to facilitate predictive modelling and decision-making in support of land-use planning, conservation and sustainability.

### Modelling biological systems

**Model biological systems from molecules to ecosystems**
Build virtual models to improve understanding of biological systems at all scales and deliver knowledge for integration into other models.

### Visualization and dissemination

**Enable rich understanding and application of biodiversity knowledge**
Provide citizens, scientists and policymakers with tools that facilitate understanding of biodiversity and enable applied use of this understanding.

### Prioritizing new data capture

**Maximize benefits from investments in biodiversity research**
Use existing information resources to plan and prioritize new data capture or efforts to digitize historical data to maximize coverage, completeness and precision of available information and to enable timely response to changes in biodiversity patterns.
