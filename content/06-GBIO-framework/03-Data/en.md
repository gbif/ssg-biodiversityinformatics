Data
===================

Building on those foundations, the Data focus area aims to accelerate the mobilization of data from all sources, unlocking the knowledge held in our collections and literature, improving data quality and filling in gaps, and bringing observations and data from all sources from satellites to genomes online.

### Published materials

**Enable digital access to all published biodiversity knowledge**
Expose the biodiversity data embedded in print publications and multimedia formats as freely available, standardized and structured information.

### Collections and specimens

**Accelerate digitization of specimen-based data**
Develop and expand efficient techniques and processes to capture and share data from natural history specimens.

### Field surveys and observations

**Ensure open and timely sharing of data from field research and citizen science**
Mobilize all biodiversity observations, including associated multimedia, as soon as possible after they are collected.

### Sequences and genomes

**Incorporate data from genomic and genetic exploration of the living world**
Capture data from molecular research on biodiversity and genetic variation, including vouchered reference sequences, sequence-based identifications, and environmental DNA and RNA.

### Automated and remote-sensed observations

**Harness automated monitoring technologies to expand data capture across the whole planet**
Automate recording and identification of species and populations with satellite-based observing systems, field-based sensors, remote-controlled systems and other technologies.
