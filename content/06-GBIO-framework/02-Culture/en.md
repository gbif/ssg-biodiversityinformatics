Culture
===================

At the root of the GBIO framework lies the culture focus area, which puts in place the necessary elements to turn biodiversity information into a common and connected resourceâ€”stable and persistent storage, pooled expertise, the culture and policies to support sharing, and common data standards.

### Open access and reuse culture

**Enable data sharing by default**
Promote open sharing of data by standardizing practice via public funding and other incentives, and through proper attribution and recognition of primary data resources, data creators and curators, including credit for individuals as well as institutions.

### Data standards

**Ensure data can be accessed, interpreted and reused between systems and across disciplines**
Develop and maintain a set of flexible and interoperable data standards for easy mobilization of all classes of biodiversity data.

### Persistent storage and archival

**Create stable data infrastructures that preserve and maintain all biodiversity data**
Establish a distributed network of data repositories for all types of biodiversity data, with consistent approaches to metadata, identifiers, licences, tools and web services.

### Policy incentives

**Create a framework of goals, rules and procedures that actively encourages sharing and reuse of all biodiversity data**
Ensure that public policies, legislation and funding initiatives at all scales combine to reinforce this strategy and support its individual components.

### Biodiversity knowledge experts

**Benefit from the expertise of the whole community**
Establish an environment which gives ownership and benefits to experts all over the world as partners in collaborative management and curation of data.
