Overview of the GBIO Framework
===================

As the primary output of of the first GBIC event, the [GBIO Framework](https://doi.org/10.15468/6jxa-yb44) can help align efforts of all stakeholders to enable integrated understanding of biodiversity.

The framework is organized into four focus areas, each of which is broken down into five core components. Each focus layer interconnects with and strengthens the others; all four are needed for biodiversity informatics to achieve its full potential. Each focus area—and the individual components within them—can advance independently, but as they do they should start to feed into and reinforce each other, making them together far greater than the sum of their parts.

### Understanding

<!---
styled custom component
you can have one or more buttons.
alignmenment options: left, center, spaceAround
title: what text should go below the icon
icon options are the ones provided in the icons folder. As of 3 feb 2019 those are: 
link: where to link to
background options: understanding, evidence, data, culture
